#### Week 1 Log (September 18th - 22nd)
* **Goal:** Speak to my mentor and find a place to start my project. Put idea into GitHub. Brainstormed ideas for blog pages
* **Accomplished:** Spoke to Mr. Tarrant, posted on GitHub, Brainstromed.

#### Week 2 (September 29th 2017)
* **Goal:** My goal today is to completely set up my blog page. I plan on having a page with bright colours and getting all the titles of my blog post availible. I will even start working on my Introduction page to kick start the website and then plan what my first blog post will be and what my first few questions will be.
* **Accomplished:** I created my blog and all the sub projects of my happy page. 

#### Week 3 (October 8 2017)
* [My Website](https://sbake15.wixsite.com/happypage)
* **Goal:** Set up the basic information to start the main blog streams so it can be published although it is not completely finished. I hope to get some pictures to start my album and find a chalkboard for my chalkboard project aswell. 
* **Accomplished:** I have the website published to start it off! There is a little more designing to do on it and a few more updates but it has started:) 

#### Week 4 (October 20th 2017)
* **Goal:** Continue on with website!! I'm hoping to have started the album by now
* **Accomplished:** I have written in 2 of my project logs but have unfortunately not started my board yet. 
* **Solution:** To fix my slight off track set, I plan on taking to Mister Tarrent (my mentor) and using his chalkboard. I have booked a meeting with him for Friday at lunch to discuss things as we move forward. I have asked 5 different people to contribute to my album so now I just need to find a time to get their small "interview"

#### Week 5 (October 27th 2017)
* **Goal:** Update site and start projects in github.
* **Accomplished:** I made an issue, 2 projects, have commented in the projects and practiced making branches in myy summer poem repository.
* **Solution:** Today I worked on figuring out my way around Github. I wanted to create at least one issue and one project to start working on. In the future I hope too work on more than one branch and I'm trying to figure out how to download git  so that I can work off of atom or brackets and then push it back into github.

#### Week 6 (November 3rd 2017)
* **Goal:** Read up on git and work on site
* **Accomplished:** I am starting to understand git and have tried to download it to my computer. I added the about page and made changes to my website.
* **Solution:** I am having a little bit of difficulty getting the git program to run on my computer so I will need help from a teacher. Me and Mr. O are working on how to work around that computer issue. Jai is helping me understand the concept of a github workflow and we are working on setting up my new computer (since the other one I was working on crashed) with all the needed programs. 

#### Week 7 (November 10th 2017)
* **Goal:** Today I realized that we needed to have an HTML aspect into our project so I am going to be working on integrating HTML code into my website base
* **Accomplished:** Today I figured out how to add code into wix account. The issue with wix is that it is a pre programmed file so adding your own code took a little bit of playing around and I am still working on the boundries for what I am capable of doing. This week I decided that my programming aspect is going to be a mascot. Below I have provided an image for one of the coding parts I have done so far. You can find mr.otter on the first page of the website and every other page you click into. Right now mr. Otter is not interactive but I'm hoping to make some of his small snipits a "click here!" sort of deal
* **Solution:** The solutions I was working on today were the adding coding. I now have 2 Mr. Otter codes that can be found in different files on this repository and plan on doing many more.
