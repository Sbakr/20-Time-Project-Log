#### Week 1 Log (September 18th - 22nd)
* **Goal:** Speak to my mentor and find a place to start my project. Put idea into GitHub. Brainstormed ideas for blog pages
* **Accomplished:** Spoke to Mr. Tarrant, posted on GitHub, Brainstromed.

#### Week 2 (September 29th 2017)
* **Goal:** My goal today is to completely set up my blog page. I plan on having a page with bright colours and getting all the titles of my blog post availible. I will even start working on my Introduction page to kick start the website and then plan what my first blog post will be and what my first few questions will be.
* **Accomplished:** I created my blog and all the sub projects of my happy page. 

#### Week 3 (October 8 2017)
* [My Website](https://sbake15.wixsite.com/happypage)
* **Goal:** Set up the basic information to start the main blog streams so it can be published although it is not completely finished. I hope to get some pictures to start my album and find a chalkboard for my chalkboard project aswell. 
* **Accomplished:** I have the website published to start it off! There is a little more designing to do on it and a few more updates but it has started:) 

#### Week 4 (October 20th 2017)
* **Goal:** Continue on with website!! I'm hoping to have started the album by now
* **Accomplished:** I have written in 2 of my project logs but have unfortunately not started my board yet. 
* **Solution:** To fix my slight off track set, I plan on taking to Mister Tarrent (my mentor) and using his chalkboard. I have booked a meeting with him for Friday at lunch to discuss things as we move forward. I have asked 5 different people to contribute to my album so now I just need to find a time to get their small "interview"
